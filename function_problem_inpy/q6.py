# Problem: Create a lambda function to compute the cube of a number.

# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

def cube(num):
    return num**3


result = cube(4)


# lamda function  - when you want to perform a function one time or least thing

cube = lambda x: x ** 3

print(cube(5))

cub = lambda x,y: x ** 3 + y

print(cub(5,2))
